                <p>
                    Our mission is to link the church of the First World with the church of the Third World in a manner
                    that
                    helps both the materially poor and the poor in spirit.

                    The materially poor are served by local churches, clergy and lay leaders who have been empowered and
                    supplied with goods by Food For The Poor.

                    The poor in spirit are renewed by their relationship with and service to the poor through our direct
                    ministry of teaching, encouragement and prayer.

                    Ultimately, we seek to bring both benefactors and recipients to a closer union with our Lord.

                <p>
                    Food For The Poor is God’s instrument to help the materially poor and to renew the poor in spirit.

                    Our ministry is a reflection of our Lord’s unconditional love – a love that surrenders all, that
                    inspires trust and faith, and that embraces all people, regardless of race, status or creed.

                    It is also shaped by our belief that Christ is alive and can be served directly by serving those in
                    greatest need. (Matthew 25:40)

                    For guidance and to maintain the purity of our mission, we stress the need for regular prayer.

                    Through surrender, service and prayer, we seek a closer union with our Lord.
